# embed-bypass
Bypass discord's patching to embeds by using its metadata readers
Put the code in a repl.it HTML, CSS & JS document, paste the code and copy the link on the top right
Pasting the link will get you the embed
NOTES: The image you wanted embedded needs to be in the form of a link, A GIF works perfectly well too
Be sure to customize it to your liking! (html do be easy to learn)
